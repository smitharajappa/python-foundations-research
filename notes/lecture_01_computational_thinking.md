# Lecture 01 – Computational Thinking

## Core Idea
Programming is the practice of giving precise, unambiguous instructions to error-intolerant machines.

## Mental Models
- Humans are contextual and error-tolerant; computers are literal and strict
- Programs are step-by-step algorithms
- Programmers act as intermediaries between user intent and hardware execution

## Research Insights
- Precision is a cognitive skill enforced by machines
- Computers excel at repetitive and exact tasks that humans find tedious
- Even minor errors can cause complete program failure

## Reflection
This lecture reframed programming as a thinking discipline rather than a syntactic skill.
