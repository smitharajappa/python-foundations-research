# Lecture 02 – Hardware Architecture & Execution Model

## Core Idea
Programs are stored in main memory and executed step-by-step by the CPU using the fetch–execute cycle.

## Mental Models
- A running program “lives” in main memory
- The CPU repeatedly asks “what instruction comes next?”
- Memory hierarchy separates execution (RAM) from persistence (secondary storage)

## Research Insights
- Computers are not intelligent; they are fast and precise
- Code is translated into machine instructions before execution
- Computation is a physical process constrained by hardware, power, and heat

## Reflection
This lecture grounded programming as a physical execution process rather than an abstract activity.
