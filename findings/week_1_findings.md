# Week 1 Findings – Python Foundations

## Experiment Summary
Conducted a simple lookup-time comparison between Python lists and dictionaries.

## Key Insight
Dictionary-based lookups scale more efficiently for large datasets, which is relevant for data indexing in ML pipelines.

## Relevance to AI
Efficient data access patterns reduce preprocessing overhead in large-scale AI systems.

## Next Step
Extend experiments to include memory usage and alternative data structures.
